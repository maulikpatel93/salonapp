# ðŸš€ Welcome to your new awesome project!

This project has been created using **webpack-cli**, you can now run

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

to bundle your application

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
npm start (starts the development server and auto-reloads the page any time you make edits)
npm run build (bundles the app into static files for production)
npm test (starts the test runner and lets you test your app with Jest as you build it)
npm run eject (takes your app out of the create-react-app setup, which lets you customize your project configuration)
